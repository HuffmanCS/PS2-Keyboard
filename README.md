# PS2-Keyboard
A repository for the "PS/2 Keyboard From Scratch" project containing the source code, design files, and documentation for a DIY keyboard driven by an AT89S52/AT89C52 microcontroller that adheres to the PS/2 Protocol.  

Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) is required for compiling the source code into an Intel hex file (binary file) that can be burnt into the MCU.  
It is also recommended you install the minipro software to use with a compatible EEPROM programmer (such as the TL866 II +).
